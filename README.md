### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**cbrown365/cbrown365** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing or if I'm doing it right.
I have absolutely no coding experience or knew that there were so many different coding languages outside of java or python.
This has the possibility of being a massive mistake.
But I hope I have the time to learn something.
